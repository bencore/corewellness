    <h2><b>Senior Product Manager</b></h2>
    <p><strong>Full-Time - San Francisco, CA - In-House</strong></p>
    <p>At Core, we’re changing the way people approach mental wellbeing. We believe that health starts with mental health – a healthy mind leads to a healthy body and a happier and more fulfilled society. &nbsp;Our entire team has experienced the incredible benefits that meditation can have, but we know it’s hard to make meditation a part of your everyday routine. The goal of our Product Management team is to design and ship experiences that make meditation easier and more engaging for all of the people who are still trying to establish the habit. </p>
    <p>You will be&nbsp;reporting directly to the CEO and responsible for setting direction, defining requirements, and coordinating the team in order to ship meaningful experiences to our customers. This includes deep collaboration across hardware, firmware, mobile, cloud, content, marketing, and customer support. You are the voice of the customer in the eyes of the entire product team, as such we will look to you as the spirit, and the glue, keeping us all moving forward. As we begin to grow beyond meditation, you will help identify other areas where we can contribute to our customers’ greater overall well-being, starting with that foundation of meditation.</p>
