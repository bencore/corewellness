    <h4>Additional Notes</h4>
    <p>We are humbled to have brought on a talented, dedicated, and experienced team so far, each of whom is making less than they could at other companies. We are not able to offer market-competitive salaries at the moment, but compensation will be re-evaluated across the board after bringing in additional fundraising.</p>
    <p>* We are an equal opportunity employer who believes a diverse team is better at tackling complex problems and coming up with innovative solutions. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, class, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. It is a priority to be a leader in employee well-being, diversity, and impact in the places we exist.</p>
    <p>** We are currently unable to sponsor any visas at the moment, but check back in with us in a few months for updates!<br><br></p>
